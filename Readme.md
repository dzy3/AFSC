AFSC: Adaptive Fourier Space Compression for Anomaly Detection

We propose two modules, namely Dilated Convolution with Dense Connection module (DCDCM) and Adaptive Fourier Space Compression module (AFSCm), for reconstruction-based anomaly detection methods. These modules can be jointed with majority of current reconstruction-based anomaly detection methods.

We provide implementation for PyTorch in the AFSC-main.py script.
