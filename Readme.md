# AFSC: Adaptive Fourier Space Compression for Anomaly Detection

We propose two modules, namely the Dilated Convolution with Dense Connection module (DCDCm) and the Adaptive Fourier Space Compression module (AFSCm), for reconstruction-based anomaly detection methods. These modules can be combined with the majority of current reconstruction-based anomaly detection methods.

We provide implementation for PyTorch in the AFSC-main.py script.
